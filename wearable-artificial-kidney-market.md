<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wearable Artificial Kidney Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>End-Stage Renal Disease</li><li>Acute Renal Disease</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Wearable Artificial Kidney market includes two main types: End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and Acute Renal Disease. ESRD refers to advanced kidney failure where the kidneys can no longer filter waste and excess fluid from the blood, requiring regular dialysis or a kidney transplant. The Wearable Artificial Kidney provides a portable and continuous dialysis solution for ESRD patients, improving their quality of life. Acute Renal Disease, on the other hand, involves a sudden loss of kidney function, often due to injury or illness, requiring temporary dialysis until the kidneys recover. The Wearable Artificial Kidney offers a convenient and efficient dialysis option for acute renal disease patients during their recovery process.</p></p>
