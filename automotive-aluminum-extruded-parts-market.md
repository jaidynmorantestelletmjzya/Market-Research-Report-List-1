<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Aluminum Extruded Parts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Extrusion Type</li><li>Indirect Extrusion Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive aluminum extruded parts market is divided into two types: direct extrusion and indirect extrusion. Direct extrusion involves pushing a billet through a die with a stationary ram, resulting in parts with a consistent cross-section. Indirect extrusion, on the other hand, uses a moving ram to push the billet against the die, creating parts with varying cross-sections. Direct extrusion is typically used for simpler shapes, while indirect extrusion is preferred for complex parts requiring precise dimensions and intricate designs.</p></p>
