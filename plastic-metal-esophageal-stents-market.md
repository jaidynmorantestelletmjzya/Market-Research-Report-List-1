<p><h1>Global Plastic & Metal Esophageal Stents Market Size and Market Trends: Insights and Projections from 2024 to 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Plastic & Metal Esophageal Stents Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Plastic and metal esophageal stents are medical devices used to treat various conditions of the esophagus, including strictures, obstructions, and cancerous growths. They are used to expand and open up the esophagus, allowing for normal swallowing and the passage of food and liquids. These stents are typically inserted into the esophagus through an endoscope or under fluoroscopic guidance.</p><p>The plastic & metal esophageal stents market has experienced significant growth in recent years and is expected to continue growing at a CAGR of 11.4% during the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the increasing prevalence of esophageal cancer and diseases that result in strictures or obstructions in the esophagus is driving the demand for esophageal stents. Additionally, advancements in stent technology, such as the development of fully covered self-expandable metal stents (SEMS), have improved the effectiveness and safety of these devices.</p><p>Another trend in the plastic & metal esophageal stents market is the rising preference for self-expandable metal stents over plastic stents. Metal stents offer several advantages, including better durability, longer patency, and easy removal when necessary. Moreover, manufacturers are focusing on developing novel stent designs and materials to further enhance patient outcomes. For instance, biodegradable stents made from materials such as polydioxanone (PDO) are being explored as a potential alternative for more temporary use, reducing the need for stent retrieval procedures.</p><p>In conclusion, the plastic & metal esophageal stents market is expected to exhibit significant growth in the coming years, driven by the increasing prevalence of esophageal diseases and advancements in stent technology. The shift towards self-expandable metal stents and the exploration of novel materials highlight the latest trends in this market.</p></p>
