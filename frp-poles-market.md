<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The FRP Poles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Filament Winding</li><li>Pultrusion</li><li>Centrifugal Casting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>FRP poles market consists of three main types: Filament Winding, Pultrusion, and Centrifugal Casting. Filament winding involves wrapping resin-saturated fibers around a rotating mandrel to create a strong, lightweight pole. Pultrusion involves pulling fibers through a resin bath and then curing them in a heated die to form a continuous profile. Centrifugal casting involves pouring resin into a rotating mold, where centrifugal force distributes the resin evenly, resulting in a high-quality, uniform pole. Each process has its own advantages and applications in the FRP poles market.</p></p>
