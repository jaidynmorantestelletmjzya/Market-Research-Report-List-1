<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plunger Lubricants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lubricating Wax</li><li>Lubricating Oil</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Plunger lubricants are available in two main types - lubricating wax and lubricating oil. Lubricating wax is a solid form of lubricant that is used by applying it directly to the plunger. It provides a protective coating that reduces friction and wear. On the other hand, lubricating oil is a liquid form of lubricant that is applied to the plunger to reduce friction between moving parts. Both types of lubricants help extend the lifespan of plungers and improve their overall performance.</p></p>
