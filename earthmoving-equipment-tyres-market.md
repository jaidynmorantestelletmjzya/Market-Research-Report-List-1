<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Earthmoving Equipment Tyres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tyres</li><li>Bias Tyres</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radial tyres and bias tyres are two main types of tyres used in earthmoving equipment. Radial tyres are constructed with ply cords that run perpendicular to the direction of travel, providing better traction, fuel efficiency, and overall performance. Bias tyres, on the other hand, have ply cords that run diagonally to the direction of travel, offering greater stability and resistance to punctures. Both types cater to different needs and preferences of users, with radial tyres being more commonly used due to their superior performance.</p></p>
