<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Femtosecond Laser Surgery Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Full Femtosecond</li><li>Half Femtosecond</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Femtosecond Laser Surgery Equipment market can be divided into two main types - full femtosecond and half femtosecond systems. Full femtosecond systems use laser technology for both the creation of the corneal flap and the actual reshaping of the cornea during surgeries such as LASIK. On the other hand, half femtosecond systems only use laser technology for creating the corneal flap, while other methods are used for the actual reshaping of the cornea, making them slightly less advanced compared to full femtosecond systems.</p></p>
