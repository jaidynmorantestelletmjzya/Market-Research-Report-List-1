<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Enclosed Screw Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Screw</li><li>Multi-screw</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Enclosed screw pumps are categorized into two main types: single screw and multi-screw pumps. Single screw pumps feature a single rotating screw within a cylindrical cavity, providing smooth and continuous flow. On the other hand, multi-screw pumps consist of multiple screws working together to create higher pressure and flow rates. Single screw pumps are preferred for applications with lower viscosity fluids, while multi-screw pumps are suitable for handling high viscosity fluids and larger flow rates. Each type offers unique advantages and capabilities to meet specific pumping requirements.</p></p>
