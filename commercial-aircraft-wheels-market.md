<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Aircraft Wheels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Main Wheel</li><li>Nose Wheel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Main wheels and nose wheels are two main types of commercial aircraft wheels used in the aviation industry. Main wheels are larger in size and typically located under the wings of the aircraft. They support the majority of the aircraft's weight during landing and takeoff. Nose wheels, on the other hand, are smaller in size and located under the front of the aircraft. They help steer the aircraft while on the ground and provide additional support during landing and takeoff. Both main wheels and nose wheels are essential components for ensuring safe and efficient aircraft operations.</p></p>
