<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intelligent Document Analysis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cloud Based</li><li>On-premise</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intelligent Document Analysis (IDA) is divided into two main market types: Cloud Based and On-premise. Cloud-based IDA involves the use of remote servers to store, process, and analyze documents. It offers flexibility, scalability, and accessibility from any location with an internet connection. On-premise IDA, on the other hand, requires the implementation of software and hardware within an organization's own infrastructure. This option provides more control and security, as data is stored locally, but it may require additional maintenance and resources. Both market types cater to different preferences and needs of organizations seeking document analysis solutions.</p></p>
