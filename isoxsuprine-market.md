<p><strong>The Isoxsuprine Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Peripheral Vasodilator</li><li>β-Sympathomimetic Agent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Isoxsuprine is a compound used in the medical field as a peripheral vasodilator, which means it helps widen the blood vessels in the body's peripheral areas. This can be beneficial in treating conditions like peripheral vascular disease and Raynaud's disease, which involve poor blood flow to the extremities. Isoxsuprine is also categorized as a β-sympathomimetic agent, meaning it stimulates β-adrenergic receptors in the sympathetic nervous system. This can cause relaxation of smooth muscles in the blood vessel walls, further aiding in vasodilation and improved blood flow.</p></p>
