<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Alarm Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional</li><li>Addressable Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fire alarm equipment market includes two types of systems: conventional and addressable. Conventional systems divide a building into zones, where each zone has a specific area covered by a group of devices. When a device detects a fire, it triggers an alarm in its respective zone without specifying the exact location. On the other hand, addressable systems assign a unique address to each device, allowing for precise identification of the location where the alarm is triggered. This helps responders quickly locate and address the fire, improving overall safety.</p></p>
